Objective or Description
The Car Price Predictor Master project aims to create a user-friendly application that predicts the selling price of a used car based on its specifications. The application uses machine learning models like Linear Regression, Lasso Regression and Random Forest Regressor to analyze historical car data and provide accurate price predictions.

The Car Price Predictor Master project is a comprehensive tool designed to assist users in determining the estimated selling price of a used car based on specific input parameters. The project integrates machine learning techniques with a user-friendly web interface to provide accurate and real-time predictions.

Project Structure
Backend (application.py):

Data Loading and Preprocessing: The cleaned car data (Cleaned_Car_data.csv) is loaded, which contains features like car name, company, year, price, kilometers driven, and fuel type.
Model Training: The script trains multiple machine learning models:
Linear Regression: A basic model to predict the car prices based on a linear relationship between the features and the target variable.
Lasso Regression: A linear model that uses L1 regularization to handle potential overfitting by penalizing the absolute size of the coefficients.
Random Forest Regressor: An ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees and merges them to get more accurate and stable predictions.
Prediction Functionality: The backend is equipped to handle user inputs, preprocess them, and pass them through the trained models to get predictions.
Frontend (index.html):

Form Inputs: The webpage contains a form where users can select or enter the car details.
JavaScript Functions: Scripts are included to handle form submissions and dynamically load car models based on the selected company.
Price Display: Once the prediction is made, the estimated price is displayed on the same page.
Data
The dataset (Cleaned_Car_data.csv) contains the following columns:

name: The name of the car.
company: The manufacturer of the car.
year: The year the car was purchased.
Price: The selling price of the car.
kms_driven: The total kilometers the car has been driven.
fuel_type: The type of fuel used by the car.
Usage
To use the Car Price Predictor:

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
Ensure all dependencies are installed using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the application script (application.py).
Open index.html in a web browser.
Fill in the car details in the form provided.
Submit the form to get the predicted price.
The Car Price Predictor Master project is an excellent example of leveraging machine learning to solve real-world problems. By providing a simple interface, it allows users to make informed decisions about selling their cars
